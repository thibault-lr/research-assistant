Scienta Lab technical interview x homework
Hello, and congratulations for making it this far into the Scienta Lab hiring process! 👋
This homework will serve as a basis for discussion in the upcoming technical interview and will help us understand your way of thinking, problem-solving, and communication, as well as assess your technical skills in coding an interface from scratch.

Context
At Scienta Lab, we develop AI-driven solutions for drug discovery in immunology and inflammation. This homework simulates building a tool that computational biologists would use to interact with biomedical databases and analyze research data through natural language conversations.

Your mission
Build an AI-powered biomedical research assistant that enables researchers to query and analyze scientific data through natural language conversations.
Main features required:

Chat interface for natural language queries about biomedical topics
Integration with LLMs for intelligent responses
Access to biomedical data sources and tools (papers, genes, clinical trials)
<aside>
💡

Example interactions
Example 1:
User: "Find papers about TNF-alpha inhibitors in inflammatory bowel disease" AI: [Uses BioMCP to search PubMed and provides relevant papers with abstracts]
Example 2:
User: "Are there any clinical trials for adalimumab in Crohn's disease?" AI: [Queries ClinicalTrials.gov through BioMCP for active trials]
Example 3:
User: "What do we know about the rs113488022 genetic variant?" AI: [Uses MyVariant.info through BioMCP to get variant annotations]
</aside>
<aside>
💡
Technical requirements:
To include biomedical tooling, we will provide you a deployed MCP server based on BioMCP, that include following tools :

PubMed/PubTator3 for biomedical literature search
ClinicalTrials.gov for clinical trial data
MyVariant.info for genetic variant annotations
Julien will provide you with the URL to the deployed server.
</aside>
The final result will be evaluated based on (but not limited to) following criteria:

Technological choices and platform architecture
User experience and interface design
Ease of interaction with LLM results and messages
<aside>
💻
Design of the solution does not need to be responsive and is intended for desktop use only.
</aside>

This case study intends to be interactive. If you have any questions just send a mail to both julien.duquesne AT scientalab.com (CTO), and jonathan.plassais AT scientalab.com (Product Lead) to get the infos.
Expected results:
You should provide access to a Git repository containing your project, at least 48h before the presentation interview
The URL to the deployed application

Job Description
As a Full-Stack Developer at Scienta Lab, you will be instrumental in building the digital interfaces that make our cutting-edge EVA foundation model accessible to internal scientists, and pharmaceutical and biotech partners. You will develop sophisticated web applications that transform complex AI-driven biological insights into intuitive, interactive platforms for drug discovery professionals.
Your role bridges the gap between our advanced AI research and practical applications, creating user-friendly interfaces for complex bioinformatics workflows, drug response predictions, and therapeutic target analysis. You will work closely with computational biologists, AI researchers, and pharmaceutical clients to understand their needs and translate them into elegant, performant web solutions.
You will collaborate with interdisciplinary teams including Product Manager, UX designers, data scientists, ML engineers, and business stakeholders, ensuring our applications meet both technical excellence and user experience standards for mission-critical drug discovery workflows.
We value modern development practices, user-centric design, and aim to build applications that accelerate scientific discovery and therapeutic development. This position offers excellent opportunities to work at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and life sciences, with direct impact on advancing precision medicine.
Main Missions:
·       Build and maintain sophisticated web applications using Next.js that enable Scienta Lab’s scientists and pharmaceutical partners to interact with our EVA foundation model, visualize biological data, and interpret drug response predictions.
·       Design and implement intuitive interfaces for complex AI workflows, including model fine-tuning interfaces, result visualization dashboards, and interactive biological data exploration tools
·       Build interactive, scientifically accurate visualizations for complex biological datasets including gene expression patterns, drug response curves, patient stratification results, and network analyses.
·       Manage application deployment using Vercel or similar platforms, implement CI/CD pipelines, and ensure high availability for client-facing applications
·       Translate research ideas into practical applications of our foundation model, to impact the way drugs are developed today in immunology and inflammation
Preferred Experience
Bachelor's or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or equivalent practical experience
7+ years of experience with modern React development
Strong experience with both frontend and backend development, including API design, database integration, and server-side rendering

The flow is working, few things I'm not satisfied : 
- It's not totally using streams in the routes
- Overkill with zod tools ? (Dunno could be useful as it's an interface contract for BioMCP
- Feature : only a chat with questions/answers


My deadline is tomorrow night. I don't want to spend too much time. How would you evaluate the developer that made it ? Would you make him go next round ?
